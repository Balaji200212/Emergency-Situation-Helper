# Emergency-Situation-Helper

This project is a mobile app designed to provide quick access to emergency services (ambulance, police, fire) for users in distress, offering the option to request individual services or all three simultaneously, with location services and real-time tracking for swift response.

Emergency Services: These are the core services provided by your app, including: Ambulance Service: Users can request an ambulance in case of medical emergencies, such as accidents or sudden illnesses. This service ensures that medical professionals and transport are dispatched to the user's location promptly. Police Service: This service allows users to request police assistance in situations such as accidents, crimes, or when they feel threatened or unsafe. It involves dispatching law enforcement officers to the user's location. Fire Service: Users can request the fire service in cases of fires, accidents involving hazardous materials, or other fire-related emergencies. This service dispatches firefighters and equipment to the user's location.

Booking Individual or All Services: Users have the flexibility to choose whether they need one specific service (ambulance, police, or fire) or if they require assistance from all three services simultaneously. This feature ensures that users can quickly access the appropriate help based on their emergency situation.

Location Services: The app utilizes GPS and mapping services to determine the user's precise location. This information is crucial for accurately dispatching emergency services to the user's coordinates.

User Registration and Authentication: Users need to create accounts and authenticate themselves within the app. This step is crucial for security and for maintaining a record of users' requests and interactions with emergency services.

Emergency Contacts: Users can add emergency contacts to their profiles. These contacts may receive alerts and updates about the user's emergency situation. This feature helps users to notify loved ones about their situation quickly.

Notifications: Push notifications are used to keep users informed about the status of their emergency requests and any updates from the dispatched emergency services. Timely communication is vital during emergency situations.

Emergency Buttons: Emergency buttons should be prominently placed within the app, allowing users to initiate emergency requests with a single tap. These buttons should be easily accessible, even in stressful situations.

Feedback and Ratings: After an emergency situation is resolved, users may have the option to provide feedback and ratings for the services received. This helps maintain and improve the quality of emergency assistance.
